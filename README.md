# Description
This plugin was supposed to be used by WavyCraftNetwork's KitPvP server. Plans changed and so this plugin is now public!

Sessions is a plugin that runs on PocketMine-MP API 5.0.0-latest. Sessions creates a session instance for a player when they join, once a player is in session it'll save certain data not saved by the internal server such as last log out location, last block mined/placed and much more!

Currently Sessions is still under development so everything is bare-bones!

All data is saved within a JSON file, I'll add MySQL support or similar in the near future!

***Note: This plugin was created for developers only as for the plugin only contains API methods helpful for other developers!***

# Features
* Save player data not saved by the internal server (e.g. How many blocks has the player broken, Which item did the player last pick-up, and more!)
* Easy to use API ❤️

# TODO
- [ ] Add multiple storage ways
- [ ] Add more events
